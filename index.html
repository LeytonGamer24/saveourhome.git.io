            "Earth is our home<br>
            It always will be,<br>
            Earth is what we all have in common<br>
            Whether we are black, or white<br>
            <br>
            We should keep our planet clean<br>
            Or we will have no planet at all<br>
            We have to stop littering and polluting our planet,<br>
            If we continue doing this we won't have a home.<br>
            <br>
            Earth does not belong to us,<br>
            We belong to the Earth<br>
            Earth is our home and we should cherish it,<br>
            When we heal the Earth, we heal ourselves<br>
            <br>
            When we honor the Earth,<br>
            We honor ourselves<br>
            The Earth breathes<br>
            The most fantastic thing is Earth<br>
            <br>
            Earth is as beautiful as life itself<br>
            Earth should be our number one priority in life to keep clean<br>
            We should not trash it with whatever garbage we have<br>
            Around 13.8 billion years ago, <br>
            there was a loud BANG!<br> And that, <br>created our Earth."<br>
